# TODO

1. search parameters in the url --> use middleware to make sure they are valid and if they are not set them to a default
2. Cart counter doesnt update instantly. Context? sad but maybe.
3. Add to cart button: if already in cart, sets quantity to 1 instead of prev + 1
6. Prices shouldn't be numbers in jsons because a user could change them.
